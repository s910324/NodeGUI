Python graph library using PySide 

Features:
- simplifies graph drawing
- several node types (text, image)
- several node connecion types
- different decorators of node connection (e.g: arrow)
- supports node draging with left mouse button
- supports node rescaling with right mouse button

Known issues:
- wrong connection node rendering under 64b Ubuntu (however, 64b Win doesn't suffer this bug)

Prerequisites:
Python, PySide

Example code showing simple graph:  
import sys
import os
from PySide.QtCore import *
from PySide.QtGui import *
from PySideGraph import *

#create simple QAppliation with desired scene canvas size
app = QApplication(sys.argv)
view = QGraphicsView()
scene = QGraphicsScene()
scene.setSceneRect(0,0,800,600)

#Select node connection and its decorator types
nc = CenterCalc()
cd = LineArrowOnStart()          

#make root node and add it to the scene
root = ImageNode(nc, cd, None, "root", QImage("pc.png"), 400, 20, 100,100 )
scene.addItem(root)

#create graph nodes
box.addChild( TextNode(nc, cd, root, "node", "Node" , 500, 340, 200, 30))  

view.setScene(scene)
view.show()

sys.exit(app.exec_())
